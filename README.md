Yield Forge is an innovative crypto staking platform that empowers users to maximize their earnings by staking their Polygon Mumbai MATIC tokens. Our platform offers a seamless and secure way for individuals to participate in the staking ecosystem and earn interest based on the duration of their stake.

At Yield Forge, we understand the importance of providing a user-friendly experience while ensuring the highest level of security for our users' assets. By leveraging the power of the Polygon network, we offer fast and cost-effective transactions, enabling users to stake their MATIC tokens without worrying about excessive gas fees or network congestion.

Staking with Yield Forge is straightforward and flexible. Users can stake their MATIC tokens for a specific period, ranging from days to weeks or even months, depending on their investment strategy and desired returns. The longer the staking duration, the higher the interest earned, rewarding users for their commitment.

Our platform employs cutting-edge algorithms to calculate the interest earned on staked tokens accurately. Users can easily track their staking progress, view real-time rewards, and monitor their overall portfolio performance through our intuitive and user-friendly dashboard.

Security is our utmost priority at Yield Forge. We have implemented robust security measures, including multi-factor authentication and cold storage for user funds, to ensure the safety of our users' assets. Our smart contract has undergone rigorous audits to provide peace of mind and build trust within our community.

Join Yield Forge today and unlock the potential of your MATIC tokens. Stake with confidence, earn passive income, and forge a path to financial growth in the exciting world of crypto staking. Experience the power of Yield Forge and embark on your journey to financial freedom.

## Built With

Built this dApp with the following tools and tech:-

* [React.js]()
* [Ethers.js]()
* [Hardhat]()
* [Solidity]()
* [Polygon Mumbai Testnet]()


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
